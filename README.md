# Paypal_Payment_app
## It's a PayPal payment gateway for E-commerce transactions built on Python-Django.

```
Download or Fork the repository on your local machine and Intsall the requrements.txt file.

Before running the project on your local server: You must add the SECRET_KEY to settings.py file.
Then Run your project -> python manage.py runserver

Goto localhost -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment 
you will see the payment page with PayPal buttons and some static content.

Before that you need to create PayPal sandbox account that I have shown in PayPal-Readme.doc.
Go through that doc carefully and create all the necessary accounts to run this project and do the successful amount transactions.

If you have any doubts please send a message to me and reach out me at anytime.
Thank you.
